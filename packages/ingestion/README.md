# `@gitblocks/ingestion`

Bounded, manifest-first ingestion of approved public GitHub repositories and
npm packages into the GitBlocks public evidence store.

The package never discovers candidates, clones repositories, downloads
tarballs, executes candidate code, or invokes a model. Network, clock,
deadline, observer, and persistence capabilities are explicit inputs. Importing
the package performs no I/O and reads no environment variables.

See [ADR 0005](../../docs/architecture/decisions/0005-public-repository-ingestion.md)
and the
[Phase 5 execution plan](../../docs/plans/0013-public-repository-ingestion.md)
for source policy, bounds, refresh semantics, and operator procedures.
